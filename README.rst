OUTDOOR
========

OUTDOOR (Open Superstructure Modeling and Optimization Framework) is a comprehensive tool for constructing and solving superstructure optimization models using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers.

Key Features
===========

* **Modular Component Library**: The `outdoor_core` module provides classes for unit operations (reactors, stream splitters, etc.) and system data components that can be assembled into custom superstructures.

* **Integrated MILP Solver**: Built-in PYOMO abstract model implementation that can be applied to various applications including biorefineries, chemical processing, and Power-to-X technologies.

* **User-Friendly Interface**: Create models through Python scripting with intuitive APIs or use the Excel-based interface for rapid model development.

* **Visualization and Analysis**: Integrated tools for reviewing model structure, analyzing results, and optimizing processes.

Installation
===========

::

    pip install outdoor

For the latest development version:

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/llvdrhau/OUTDOOR_USC.git

Usage
=====

OUTDOOR provides multiple ways to define your superstructure models:

2. **Excel Templates**: Use predefined templates to configure your models
3. **GUI Interface**: Visual modeling environment (if available in your installation)
