## The goal of this file is to write down errors I encounter that should be fixed in the future.


Problem 1 ):

* Imagine process a where fresh tomatoes enter. Tomatoes contain water, in fact more water then is needed to be
added in the process! (Determined by the concentration Factor parameter)
=> ERROR for mass balances:
MassBalance_1, MassBalance_2, MassBalance_4, MassBalance_6, MassBalance_9, MassBalance_11, MassBalance_14, MassBalance_16
So need a method to check if the mass balance is correct and that an overflow of water is not possible.


FOR LCA OF UTLITIES:
Impact factors need to be in unit_ImpCat/MW! if unit is kW divied my 1000 to get MW!

Impact_UT = consumption (MW) * Impact_factor (kg_co2/kWh) * 1000 (to get MW) * 8760 (working hours in a year)


# deleting previous Calculate LCA's? (yes/no) how?

# test multiple outputs can only one be selected to go to one unit. Check if model breaks yes or no!

# I need to make sure that temperatures are always filled in!! otherwise you'll get anying errors!!

# when deleting a chemical component it needs to be deleted throughout ALL units!

# set guard rails in the makeSuperstructure file if you see fishy data!!


# 1
Test if the newly added equations in OUTDOOR work correctly

# 2
the curves don't save well, fix this

# 3
Making a warning when you have not filled in upper and lower bounds for the input dialogs

# 4
Make a warning NOT AN ERROR when mass balances are over 1! they don't have to be 1
(think of COD balances, CO2 or water don't really get considered in these bichemical reactions)

# 5
In the readME add that the units for WWTP is in m3 and that in reality the better metric to evaluate
WWTP is by the organic load (kgCOD/day) and not by the volume of water treated
