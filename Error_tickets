## The goal of this file is to write down errors I encounter that should be fixed in the future.


Problem 1 ):

* Imagine process a where fresh tomatoes enter. Tomatoes contain water, in fact more water then is needed to be
added in the process! (Determined by the concentration Factor parameter)
=> ERROR for mass balances:
MassBalance_1, MassBalance_2, MassBalance_4, MassBalance_6, MassBalance_9, MassBalance_11, MassBalance_14, MassBalance_16
So need a method to check if the mass balance is correct and that an overflow of water is not possible.


FOR LCA OF UTLITIES:
Impact factors need to be in unit_ImpCat/MW! if unit is kW divied my 1000 to get MW!

Impact_UT = consumption (MW) * Impact_factor (kg_co2/kWh) * 1000 (to get MW) * 8760 (working hours in a year)


# deleting previous Calculate LCA's? (yes/no) how?

# test multiple outputs can only one be selected to go to one unit. Check if model breaks yes or no!

# I need to make sure that temperatures are always filled in!! otherwise you'll get anying errors!!

# when deleting a chemical component it needs to be deleted throughout ALL units!

# set guard rails in the makeSuperstructure file if you see fishy data!!
