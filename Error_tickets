## The goal of this file is to write down errors I encounter that should be fixed in the future.


Problem 1 ):

* Imagine process a where fresh tomatoes enter. Tomatoes contain water, in fact more water then is needed to be
added in the process! (Determined by the concentration Factor parameter)
=> ERROR for mass balances:
MassBalance_1, MassBalance_2, MassBalance_4, MassBalance_6, MassBalance_9, MassBalance_11, MassBalance_14, MassBalance_16
So need a method to check if the mass balance is correct and that an overflow of water is not possible.

problem 2 ):
when changing the name of a reaction in the reaction list, the name of the reaction in the reaction list is changed but
in the dialog the reaction get's set to the first reaction in the list! This is not correct and should be fixed.



FOR LCA OF UTLITIES:
Impact factors need to be in unit_ImpCat/MW! if unit is kW divied my 1000 to get MW!

Impact_UT = consumption (MW) * Impact_factor (kg_co2/kWh) * 1000 (to get MW) * 8760 (working hours in a year)
