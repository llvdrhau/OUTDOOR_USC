    Class description
    -----------------

    This Class models an Combined heat and power unit (CHP)
    It inherits from the StoichReactor Class.
    Therefore, it includes capital costs factors, energy demand factors,
    mass balance factors as well as the stoichiometric reaction facotrs.
    This class adds parameters to calculate the produced amount of steam
    based on efficiency.

    Note: The energy production calculation in the SuperstructureModel is based
    on the inlet mass flow and the lower heating value of the components combined
    with the here defined overall efficiency value.
    It is assumed that HeatGenerators produce heat at the highest Heat-Temperature
    which is defined for the Superstructure-Class (boundary conditions).
