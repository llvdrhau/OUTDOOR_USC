Just some notes on the AgriLoop potato peel waste (PPW) case study to keep track of the progress and issues.


found an important bug in the code, if you send source units (i.e., inputs like PPW) to multiple sinks the stream
to which the source is connected is not the same arcoss multiple scenarios during the stochastic optimization!!
----------------------------TIPS-----------------
# 1) to avoid getting error when running the analysis (creating the flowsheert) and to visualise this error make sure NOT to use _tidy_data in StochasticModelOutput_mpi_sppy class
# 2) make sure in the methode def scenario_creator(self, scenarioName): that Y_DIST and Y are the stage 1 variables (optimiser class)
# 3) hack: MAKE SURE PWW IS ONLY CONNECTED TO ONE SINK IN THE SUPERSTRUCTURE (i.e., the GRINDER) that way you avoid this error

SOLUTION: in the model constraint: ProcessGroup_logic_2_rule their is a variable self.connections.items()
make sure through the EXCEL file that you specify that the source can only go to one sink! (like you would do in Material flow soures of a unit process)

IMPLEMENTED ATM: Just make sure that the source is only connected to one sink in the superstructure (i.e., the GRINDER)


-----------------------------------------------------
Something I still want to do: make the scenario analysis more comprehensive by adding results from the here and now caluculations
to the tail ends of the box plots, that way you can really see the associate risk of the scenarios with the here and now results added to the
wait and see results.

SEE here and now problem below that we need to fix first.

-----------------------------------------------------
problem Here and now
 figure out why only +/- 60% of the scenarios are feasible in here_and_now.py?
 in wait_and_see_analysis.py almost all scenarios are feasible, what is going wrong here?
